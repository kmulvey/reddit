Be patient.\n\nRemember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language. (Meaning and tone can be lost in translation.)\n\n## 3. Be thoughtful.\n\nProductive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted. Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.\n\n## 4. Be respectful.\n\nIn particular, respect differences of opinion.\n\n## 5. Be charitable.\n\nInterpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree. When we do disagree, try to understand why.\n\n## 6. Be constructive.\n\nAvoid derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation. Avoid unconstructive criticism: don't merely decry the current state of affairs; offer—or at least solicit—suggestions as to how things may be improved. Avoid snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments) Avoid discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict. Avoid microaggressions\n\n## 7. Be responsible.\n\nWhat you say and do matters. Take responsibility for your words and actions, including their consequences, whether intended or otherwise.\n\n## 8. Follow the Go Code of Conduct\n\nAs a part of the Go community, this subreddit and those who post on it should follow the tenets laid out in the Go Code of Conduct: https://golang.org/conduct\n\nTreat everyone with respect and kindness. Be thoughtful in how you communicate. Don’t be destructive or inflammatory.\n\n## 9. Must be Go Related\n\nPosts must be of interest to Go developers and related to the Go language.\n\nThis includes: - Articles about the language itself - Announcements &amp; articles about open source Go libraries or applications - Dev tools (open source or not) specifically targeted at Go developers\n\nWe ask that you not post about closed-source / paid software that is not specifically aimed at Go developers in particular (as opposed to all developers), even if it is written in Go.\n\n## 10. Do Not Post Pirated Material\n\nDo not post links to or instructions on how to get pirated copies of copyrighted material.\n\n## 11. Job Posts Go in the \"Who's Hiring?\" Post\n\nWe have a monthly \"Who's Hiring?\" post that will stay pinned to the top of the subreddit. To avoid too much noise from companies, please post job openings there. Please keep in mind, this is for 1st party postings only. No 3rd party recruiters.\n\n# Documentation\n\n* [Official Go Documentation](http://go.dev/doc)\n* [Standard Library Docs](http://pkg.go.dev/std)\n* [Other Package Docs](http://pkg.go.dev)\n\n# Community\n\n* [Go Nuts Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts)\n* [Go questions in Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/go)\n* [Resources for new Go programmers](http://dave.cheney.net/resources-for-new-go-programmers)",
